# WaveNet-based approximation of a normal-hearing cochlear filter and hair-cell transduction model
This repository contains code for a WaveNet-based approximation of the normal-hearing cochlear filtering and hair-cell transduction stages of the Zilany &amp; Bruce auditory model (JASA 2006).

When using the WaveNet auditory model, plase cite the following paper:
